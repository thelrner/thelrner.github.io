Part cellular automata sandbox, part snake.

Regular snake rules apply. Wage war on evil red cells -- eat apples to spawn friendly cells. Snake can pass through cells. Capture enemy cells by surrounding them with your own.

Key features:

Built in pure javascript, renders every ~75ms by reassigning classes on 2,500 'pixel' elements on the page.
Heightened user responsiveness via command queue & turn preprocessing.
Much better than regular Snake.
